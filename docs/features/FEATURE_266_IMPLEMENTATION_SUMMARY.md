## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Flexible Bidding System

✅ **CPC (Cost Per Click)**:
- Vendor pays fixed amount per click
- Minimum bid: ₹1
- Direct cost tracking

✅ **CPM (Cost Per Mille - 1000 impressions)**:
- Vendor pays per 1000 impressions
- Minimum bid: ₹10
- Estimated CPC calculated based on CTR

### 2. Smart Auction Algorithm

✅ **Composite Scoring**:
```
Score = Bid Amount × (Relevance/100) × (Quality/100)
```

✅ **Relevance Score Components**:
- Keyword matching (0-50 points)
- Category matching (0-30 points)
- Placement matching (0-20 points)

✅ **Quality Score Components**:
- CTR performance (0-30 points)
- Recency boost (0-20 points)
- Base score: 50 points

**Result**: Well-targeted ads can win with lower bids

### 3. Budget Management

✅ **Two-tier budgets**:
- Daily budget (resets at midnight)
- Total campaign budget

✅ **Auto-pause**:
- When daily budget exhausted
- When total budget exhausted
- When campaign end date reached

✅ **Manual controls**:
- Pause/resume anytime
- Update budgets (draft or active)
- Delete drafts only

### 4. Fraud Prevention

✅ **Duplicate Click Detection**:
- 5-minute window per user/session
- TTL indexes for auto-cleanup
- Prevents rapid-fire clicking

✅ **Pattern Analysis**:
- IP abuse detection (>10 clicks/24h)
- Session abuse (>5 clicks, no conversion)
- Low conversion rate flagging (<0.1% with >50 clicks)

✅ **Admin Review**:
- Fraud detection API endpoint
- Suspicious pattern reports
- Manual refund capability

### 5. Performance Tracking

✅ **Campaign Metrics**:
- Impressions (total views)
- Clicks (total clicks)
- CTR (click-through rate)
- Average CPC
- Total spend (daily + cumulative)

✅ **Analytics Breakdowns**:
- By date
- By placement (search, category, etc.)
- By keyword
- Conversion tracking

✅ **Vendor Dashboard**:
- Total campaigns
- Active campaigns
- Total impressions/clicks
- Total spend
- Average CTR
- Conversion rate
- ROI metrics

### 6. Targeting Options

✅ **Keywords**:
- Array of target keywords
- Fuzzy matching in auction
- Performance per keyword

✅ **Placements**:
- Search results
- Category pages
- Homepage
- Product detail pages

✅ **Categories**:
- Target specific categories
- 30-point boost for category match

### 7. Campaign Lifecycle

```
draft → active → paused/expired/completed
              ↓
           resume (if paused)
```

✅ **Statuses**:
- `draft`: Being created, can edit/delete
- `active`: Running, limited edits
- `paused`: Manually stopped or budget exhausted
- `expired`: End date reached
- `completed`: Successfully finished

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes

✅ **AdCampaign Indexes**:
```javascript
{ vendor: 1, status: 1 }
{ status: 1, startDate: 1, endDate: 1 }
{ keywords: 1, status: 1 }
{ placements: 1, status: 1 }
```

✅ **AdClick Indexes**:
```javascript
{ campaign: 1, clickedAt: -1 }
{ vendor: 1, clickedAt: -1 }
{ convertedToOrder: 1, clickedAt: -1 }
{ user: 1, campaign: 1, clickedAt: 1 } expireAfterSeconds: 300
{ sessionId: 1, campaign: 1, clickedAt: 1 } expireAfterSeconds: 300
```

### Caching Strategy (Pending)

- [ ] Redis cache for active campaigns (5 min TTL)
- [ ] Cache by placement + keywords + category
- [ ] Invalidate on campaign status change
- [ ] Batch impression tracking (queue, process every 10s)

### Query Optimization

✅ **Implemented**:
- Lean queries in auction (no populate)
- Field selection (only needed fields)
- Populate winners only

**Pending**:
- [ ] Archive old clicks (>90 days)
- [ ] Aggregate click data for faster analytics
- [ ] Implement read replicas for analytics

---

## Security Considerations

### Fraud Prevention

✅ **Click Fraud**:
- 5-minute duplicate window
- TTL indexes auto-cleanup
- IP/session tracking

✅ **Pattern Detection**:
- Rapid clicks from same IP
- Multiple clicks without conversion
- Abnormally low conversion rates

### Access Control

⚠️ **Pending Auth Integration**:
- Campaign CRUD: Vendor owns resource
- Analytics: Vendor sees own data only
- Admin: Override all restrictions
- Public: Impression/click tracking

### Data Privacy

✅ **User Data**:
- IP addresses logged (for fraud)
- User agent logged (for analytics)
- No PII stored beyond user ID

⚠️ **Pending**:
- [ ] GDPR compliance review
- [ ] Data retention policy (90 days?)
- [ ] User right to deletion
