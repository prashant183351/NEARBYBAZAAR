## 🔄 Status Flow

The RMA system supports **21 different states** covering the complete lifecycle:

### Customer Journey
1. **requested** → Customer initiates return
2. **return_label_sent** → Label provided
3. **shipped_back** → Item shipped
4. **refunded** → Money returned

### Vendor/Supplier Journey
1. **vendor_reviewing** → Vendor evaluates
2. **vendor_approved/rejected** → Decision made
3. **supplier_reviewing** (dropship only)
4. **received_by_vendor/supplier** → Item received
5. **inspecting** → Condition check
6. **inspection_passed/failed** → Quality decision
7. **refund_processing** → Payment processing
8. **refunded/partially_refunded/replaced** → Resolution

## 🎯 Key Features Designed

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Documented test requirements:
- Unit tests for status transitions
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflow
- Edge cases (partial returns, concurrent updates)
- Multi-party notification flow testing

## 📊 Business Rules (To Define)

The stub identifies key policy decisions needed:
- Return window (30/60 days)
- Refund policy (full/partial/store credit)
- Shipping cost responsibility
- Inspection criteria
- Fraud prevention thresholds

## 🔗 Integration Points

Designed to integrate with:
- **Notifications** (Feature #144) - Status updates
- **Compliance** (Feature #143) - Return policy acceptance
- **Payment Gateway** - Refund processing
- **Shipping Provider** - Label generation and tracking
- **Inventory System** - Stock updates

## 🚀 Next Steps

When ready to implement:
1. Define vendor return policies (config/settings)
2. Integrate shipping provider API
3. Implement payment gateway refunds
4. Build UI components (customer + vendor)
5. Add comprehensive testing
6. Create admin analytics dashboard

## ⚠️ Current Status

**ALL CODE IS STUB/PLACEHOLDER**
- Models are complete and ready to use
- API endpoints return stub responses
- Service functions have TODO comments
- No real business logic implemented
- UI shows dummy data only

This provides a solid foundation for full RMA implementation when prioritized!
