## Module 2: Bulk Pricing Strategy (30 minutes)

### Lesson 2.1: Understanding Tiered Pricing

**Concept:** Offer discounts based on quantity purchased.

**Example Product:**
```
Product: Premium Cotton T-Shirts
Retail Price: ₹300 per piece

Tier Structure:
┌────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────────┐
│ Quantity       │ Price    │ Discount │ Buyer   │
│                │          │          │ Saves   │
├────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼─────────┤
│ 1-49 (Retail)  │ ₹300     │ 0%       │ ₹0      │
│ 50-99 (Tier 1) │ ₹270     │ 10%      │ ₹1,500  │
│ 100-199        │ ₹240     │ 20%      │ ₹6,000  │
│ 200+ (Tier 3)  │ ₹210     │ 30%      │ ₹18,000 │
└────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴─────────┘

Your Revenue:
- 50 units × ₹270 = ₹13,500 (vs ₹6,000 for 20 retail)
- 200 units × ₹210 = ₹42,000 (vs ₹9,000 for 30 retail)
```

---

### Lesson 2.2: Creating Your First Tier

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to product:** Dashboard → Products → Select product
2. **Scroll to "Bulk Pricing"** section
3. **Click "Add Tier"**

**Tier 1 (Starter Bulk):**
```
Min Quantity: 50
Price per Unit: ₹270
Discount %: 10%
```

4. **Add Tier 2:**
```
Min Quantity: 100
Price per Unit: ₹240
Discount %: 20%
```

5. **Add Tier 3:**
```
Min Quantity: 200
Price per Unit: ₹210
Discount %: 30%
```

6. **Save** changes

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start with conservative discounts (10-15%). You can always increase later.

---

### Lesson 2.3: Pricing Templates

**Use Case:** Apply same tier structure to multiple products.

**Conservative Template (Low Risk):**
```
Tier 1: MOQ 25, 10% off
Tier 2: MOQ 50, 15% off
Tier 3: MOQ 100, 20% off
```

**Balanced Template (Recommended):**
```
Tier 1: MOQ 50, 15% off
Tier 2: MOQ 100, 20% off
Tier 3: MOQ 200, 25% off
```

**Aggressive Template (High Volume):**
```
Tier 1: MOQ 100, 20% off
Tier 2: MOQ 250, 25% off
Tier 3: MOQ 500, 30% off
```

**Application:**
1. Dashboard → Products → Bulk Actions
2. Select multiple products (checkbox)
3. "Apply Pricing Template" → Choose template
4. Preview → Confirm

---

### Lesson 2.4: Pricing Psychology

**✅ DO:**
- End prices with 9 or 0 (₹99, ₹150, not ₹102)
- Show "You Save ₹X" prominently
- Create urgency ("Limited stock for bulk orders")
- Bundle complementary products

**❌ DON'T:**
- Price below cost (even for bulk)
- Offer same discount to all tiers (no incentive to buy more)
- Change pricing weekly (confuses buyers)
- Ignore competitor pricing

**🧠 Pricing Formula:**
```
Cost per Unit: ₹X
Desired Margin: 20-30%
Retail Price = Cost × (1 + Margin)

Bulk Discounts:
Tier 1: Retail - 10%
Tier 2: Retail - 20%
Tier 3: Retail - 30%

Example:
Cost: ₹100
Retail: ₹100 × 1.30 = ₹130
Tier 1: ₹117 (10% off)
Tier 2: ₹104 (20% off)
Tier 3: ₹91 (30% off)
```

---

## Module 3: RFQ Mastery (45 minutes)

### Lesson 3.1: What is an RFQ?

**RFQ = Request for Quotation**

Buyer submits custom requirements:
- Large quantities (beyond standard tiers)
- Product customization (logo, colors, specs)
- Special delivery terms
- Products not in your catalog

**Why RFQs are Gold:**
- Higher order values (avg ₹50,000 - ₹5,00,000)
- Pre-qualified buyers (serious, not browsing)
- Custom pricing (better margins)
- Long-term relationships

---

### Lesson 3.2: Reading an RFQ

**Sample RFQ:**
```

### Lesson 3.4: Pricing Your RFQ Quote

**Calculation Worksheet:**

```
COST ANALYSIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Base Product Cost:
   ₹60 per t-shirt × 5,000 = ₹3,00,000

2. Customization Cost:
   Logo printing: ₹10 per piece
   ₹10 × 5,000 = ₹50,000

3. Delivery Cost:
   Bulk shipping to Mumbai: ₹10,000

4. Total Cost:
   ₹3,00,000 + ₹50,000 + ₹10,000 = ₹3,60,000

5. Desired Margin:
   25% profit margin
   ₹3,60,000 × 1.25 = ₹4,50,000

6. Competitive Adjustment:
   Target price: ₹80-90
   Your quote: ₹85 (₹4,25,000 total)
   Margin: 18% (acceptable)

FINAL QUOTE: ₹85 per piece (₹4,25,000 total)
```

**Margin Guidelines:**
- Minimum acceptable: 15%
- Sweet spot: 20-25%
- Premium (if unique offering): 30%+

### Lesson 3.5: Negotiation Tactics

**Scenario 1: Buyer asks for lower price**

**Buyer:** "Can you do ₹75 per piece?"

**❌ Bad Response:**
"Sorry, that's too low."

**✅ Good Response:**
"I appreciate your budget concern. At ₹75, we'd be
below our cost given the 2-color printing and premium
cotton. However, I can offer:

OPTION 1: ₹80 per piece for 6,000+ pieces
OPTION 2: ₹82 per piece with single-color logo
OPTION 3: ₹85 as quoted (our best price for 5,000)

Which option works best for you?"

---

**Scenario 2: Buyer wants faster delivery**

**Buyer:** "Can you deliver in 7 days instead of 15?"

**✅ Response:**
"Expedited production is possible for an additional
₹15,000 rush fee (₹3 per piece). This covers:
- Priority production scheduling
- Express shipping

Updated timeline: 7 days from logo approval
Updated total: ₹4,40,000

Would you like to proceed with expedited service?"

---

**Scenario 3: Buyer wants better payment terms**

**Buyer:** "Can we do Net 60 instead of Net 30?"

**✅ Response:**
"We can accommodate Net 60 for an additional 2%
(₹8,500) to cover the extended credit period.

Alternatively, if you can do 50% advance + 50% Net
30, we can maintain the original price of ₹4,25,000.

Which option would you prefer?"

**💡 Negotiation Principles:**
1. Never say flat "no" - offer alternatives
2. Be flexible on payment terms (easier than price)
3. Bundle extras for volume increases
4. Know your walk-away point (minimum margin)

---

## Module 4: Credit Sales (30 minutes)

### Lesson 4.1: How Credit Orders Work

**Traditional (Risky):**
```
You → Ship product → Wait 30 days → Hope buyer pays
Risk: Buyer might not pay!
```

**NearbyBazaar B2B (Safe):**
```
Buyer → Places order → Platform pays YOU instantly →
You ship → Platform collects from buyer later
Risk: ZERO! Platform guarantees payment.
```

**Timeline Example:**
```
Day 1: Buyer orders ₹1,00,000 (Net 30)
Day 2: ₹97,000 deposited in your account*
Day 3: You ship the order
Day 31: Platform collects ₹1,00,000 from buyer

*After 3% platform fee
```

---

### Lesson 4.2: Payment Term Types

**Full Advance (No Credit):**
```
Buyer pays: 100% before shipment
You receive: 100% before shipment
Risk: None
Use for: New buyers, high-value items
```

**Partial Advance (Most Common):**
```
Example: 30-70 split
Buyer pays: 30% upfront, 70% on delivery
You receive: 30% immediately, 70% after delivery
Risk: Low (product already shipped)
Use for: Regular customers, standard orders
```

**Net 30:**
```
Buyer pays: Full amount within 30 days
You receive: Full amount within 24 hours
Risk: None (platform guarantee)
Use for: Established B2B customers
```

**Net 60:**
```
Buyer pays: Full amount within 60 days
You receive: Full amount within 24 hours
Risk: None (platform guarantee)
Use for: Large enterprises, high-value orders
```

---

### Lesson 4.3: Setting Your Credit Policy

**Dashboard → Settings → B2B Config → Credit Policy**

**Recommended Settings:**

```
┌──────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Payment Term     │ Min Order   │ Auto-Approve │
├──────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Full Advance     │ ₹0          │ ✅ Yes       │
│ Partial (30-70)  │ ₹10,000     │ ✅ Yes       │
│ Net 30           │ ₹25,000     │ ⚠️ Manual    │
│ Net 60           │ ₹50,000     │ ⚠️ Manual    │
└──────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────┘
```

**Auto-Approve vs Manual:**
- **Auto:** System approves if buyer has credit limit
- **Manual:** You review each credit order (safer for new vendors)

**Starting Out:** Use Manual review for first month, then switch to Auto once comfortable.

---

### Lesson 4.4: Managing Credit Orders

**Dashboard → Orders → Credit Sales**

**Order Status Colors:**
```
🟢 Green: Buyer paid, all clear
🟡 Yellow: Payment due soon (7 days)
🔴 Red: Payment overdue (platform handling)
```

**What to Monitor:**
- Active credit orders (not yet paid by buyer)
- Payment due dates
- Your payout status (already received or pending)

**💡 Key Point:** Even if buyer's payment is overdue, you already got paid. Platform handles collections, not your problem!

---

## Module 5: Analytics & Optimization (30 minutes)

### Lesson 5.1: Reading Your Dashboard

**Dashboard → B2B Analytics**

**Key Metrics:**

```
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ BULK REVENUE:  ₹15,00,000           ┃
┃ (45 orders, 30 days)                ┃
┃ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ┃
┃ RETAIL REVENUE: ₹8,00,000           ┃
┃ (320 orders, 30 days)               ┃
┃ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ┃
┃ BULK VS RETAIL RATIO: 65.2%        ┃
┃ ⭐ Excellent! Target: 60-70%        ┃
┃ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ┃
┃ AVG BULK ORDER: ₹33,333            ┃
┃ ✅ Good! Target: ₹15K-₹50K         ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

**What These Mean:**

**Bulk vs Retail Ratio:**
- <40%: Not using bulk pricing enough
- 40-60%: Good start
- 60-80%: Excellent! Sweet spot
- >80%: Maybe price retail too high?

**Avg Bulk Order Value:**
- <₹10,000: Tiers may be too low
- ₹15-50K: Perfect range
- >₹1,00,000: May scare small businesses

---

### Lesson 5.2: Optimizing Pricing

**Steps:**

1. **Export Data:**
   Dashboard → Analytics → Export CSV

2. **Open in Excel:**
   Look for:
   - Which tier is used most?
   - Which products sell best at bulk?
   - What's the avg discount given?

3. **Adjust Tiers:**
   
   **If Tier 1 underused (too high MOQ):**
   ```
   Before: Tier 1 starts at 100 units
   After: Tier 1 starts at 50 units
   ```

   **If Tier 3 overused (too good a deal):**
   ```
   Before: Tier 3 = 30% off
   After: Add Tier 4 at 35% off, keep Tier 3 at 25%
   ```

   **If avg discount >25% (margins too thin):**
   ```
   Reduce all tier discounts by 5%
   ```

4. **Test for 2 weeks:**
   Monitor if changes improve or hurt sales

5. **Repeat monthly:**
   Continuous optimization

---

### Lesson 5.3: Regional Analysis

**Dashboard → Analytics → Regional**

**Use Case:** Focus marketing on top regions.

**Example Data:**
```
┌────────────┬────────┬────────────┐
│ Region     │ Orders │ Revenue    │
├────────────┼────────┼────────────┤
│ West       │ 25     │ ₹8,50,000  │
│ North      │ 12     │ ₹4,20,000  │
│ South      │ 8      │ ₹2,30,000  │
└────────────┴────────┴────────────┘
```

**Action:**
- Run ads targeting West region (highest revenue)
- Consider warehouse near West for faster delivery
- Investigate why South is low (marketing? shipping cost?)
